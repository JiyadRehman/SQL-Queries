# SQL-Queries
Developed a database on Oracle that could store information about soccer teams and their matches

The database also holds information about team coaches as well.

The first step was to create an ERD and then Create tables using SQL commands.

After that, I inserted some records and then queried the data.

Multiple SQL files and detail files are in the repository.

Naming conventions will share the sequence of these files.
